# Friend-Family-Travel-Diary
This is an android application made with java and xml for one of my classes. We created this app in a group of 4. I was in charge of the authentication but I also designed and made most of the UI for this app.

Here is the exact assignment:

Develop a website or an android application to help user keep track and record family and friend history and events. Your system (a website or app or combo) should be able to record ancestry information, current events, post videos and photos and more. It will however not be a social networking platform, it is more of a dynamic storage of family & friend events (i.e. videos, pictures and comments). Your system should minimally include the following components:
•	User Registration: Establish user/password and initial access rights (i.e. coordinator or regular member)
•	User login: User must login before they can access the system. Provide a means in case they forgot user id or password. No password expiration is necessary. 
•	Access rights: Allow coordinator to add new members or change access rights as a coordinator or a regular member (i.e. just view, not allowed to post)
•	Family ancestry link: To hold family members pictures and hierarchy (i.e. grandparents, parents, children, etc.) allow adding branches and sub-branches)
•	Friend history link: Include all past and current friends (i.e. add text, video or pictures)
•	Events link: Post pictures, comments and videos from events (i.e. weddings, graduating)
•	Travel link: Post pictures, comments and videos from various trips
•	“Just happened” link: Post current events (i.e. text, video, photos, links)
•	Buck-list link: Experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime (a google definition of bucket list). Allow mark it as “complete, “in progress” or “to be completed”
